    <h1>Croissant</h1>
    <p>
        A croissant is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry inspired by the shape
        of the
        Austrian kipferl but using the French yeast-leavened laminated dough. Croissants are named for their
        historical
        crescent shape. The dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded several times in succession, then rolled
        into a thin
        sheet, in a technique called laminating. The process results in a layered, flaky texture, similar to a puff
        pastry.
